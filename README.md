### How to Development

1.**boot.py** will run at first

2.next will run **main.py**

3.if want use **run in m5stack right now**, please note:

```python
from m5stack import *
from uiflow import *

while True:
    # must call in while True
    checkExit()
    # or
    wait_ms(1)
    # or
    wait(1)
```

4.example control lcd

- Core enter development mode (m5-micropython show in lcd), use vscode to connect

- Open main.py and write

``` python
from m5stack import *
from uiflow import *
from m5ui import *
import time

setScreenColor(0x222222)

label1 = M5TextBox(120, 103, "Text", lcd.FONT_Default,0xFFFFFF, rotate=0)

while True:
    label1.setText(str(time.ticks_ms()))
    checkExit()
```

- try use **run in m5stack** to test is the code correct?

- if ok, press **ctrl+s** to save, it will auto write to core

- reboot core(not enter development mode ),it will run....

## Offline with uiflow

try copy uiflow code to main.py, it will work well
